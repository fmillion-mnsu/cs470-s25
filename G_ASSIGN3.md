# Alternative UI Game Design

Many games follow standard user interface designs and paradigms. Input devices such as the standard Xbox/PlayStation controller design and its derivatives, VR headsets and keyboard/mouse play are relatively standardized as input methodologies. However, nearly all games designed today are designed for, or at least optimized for, "able-bodied" individuals - people without disabilities.

In this exercise, you will either:

* Consider an existing game and design accessibility features for the game to make the game more playable by individuals with varying disabilities, or
* Design your own simple game from scratch, targeting players with a disability.

## Existing Games

Many existing games do support varying degrees of accessibility features. More recent games such as The Last Of Us have taken significant steps to provide for accessibility for all players - even players with visual disabilities, photosensitive epilepsy, hearing difficulties and so on. However, most games still do not have such features.

If you go with this option, you can choose a game as a group and investigate its existing accessibility features - if any - and then discuss and design additional features to expand on the accessibility features already provided. 

A few caveats:

* The Last Of Us is a prime example of accessibility-first game design - please do try to consider games that offer fewer accessibility features as they are today. 
* Avoid games that are already designed specifically for individuals with disabilities. 
* The genre of game is not important, but avoid "conversions" of non-computer games (e.g. card games, board games, etc. played on a computer). 

## New Game

If you choose, you could also write up a game design document for a new game that does not yet exist. You do not need to go too far with this - you don't need to design the next Minecraft or Doom game - but you should consider a game at the scope of a typical casual game. Example game genres you can think about are simple puzzle games like Candy Crush, action games like racing or fighting games, or turn-based mobile games. 

This is a **group submission** - each group need only submit *one* essay.
