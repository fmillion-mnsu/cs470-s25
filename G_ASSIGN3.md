# Accessible Game Design

Many games follow standard user interface designs and paradigms. Input devices such as the standard Xbox/PlayStation controller design and its derivatives, VR headsets and keyboard/mouse play are relatively standardized as input methodologies. However, nearly all games designed today are designed for, or at least optimized for, "able-bodied" individuals - people without disabilities. There are a lot of efforts that have been made to improve game accessibility across many types of abilities and disabilities, however this is still an ongoing effort among game designers, developers and producers. This exercise will give you a chance to get a small taste of how game accessibility cam be not only relatively easy, but *fun* to implement.

In this exercise, you will find an existing simple casual game written in PyGame (or another framework if you choose), and you will add one specific accessibility feature to the game of your group's choosing.

## Steps

1. Explore GitHub or other public source code repositories to find a *simple, casual* game written in a framework your group feels comfortable working with. As a "default", I would highly recommend PyGame, as it is a well-documented library for programming simple games in Python and is used by many casual games. It also avoids the complexities usually seen in larger game frameworks like Unity or Unreal, and as a Python library, you are already familiar with how to code in the programming language used. 

    > Note that you *are* allowed to choose a different game framework, but your entire group should agree on this decision if you make it.

    > I **strongly** recommend sticking to casual games, as anything beyond simple games like Space Invaders, Flappy Bird, Pac-Man, Match-3 games (Candy Crush etc.) and so on will prove much more difficult for you to design accommodations for in a short time.

1. Download and explore the source code.

1. Decide on one **specific** accessibility feature that you will add to the game to enable easier gameplay by individuals with a disability. You can choose the disability you want to adapt for - blindness, deaf/hard of hearing, motor impairments, etc. Your feature should be simple to use and you should be able to hypothesize that the feature will provide significant improvements in playability for individuals with the given disability.

    > Think creatively! Please avoid "obvious" low-hanging fruit like adding captions to spoken lines or sound effects. If you're thinking of writing an accessibility feature for individuals who are hard of hearing, think of *other* things you could add - as just one example, unique visual indicators for sounds, especially when the *location* of those sounds is important in the gameplay!

1. Implement and test your accessibility feature.

1. Write a short report explaining the feature you chose to implement, the target audience (i.e. what disability/disabilities your feature supports) and explain how to actually use the feature you implemented.

    Additionally, record a short video (less than 5 minutes) illustrating your feature in action. You can use OBS Studio, Windows Xbox Game Bar or similar free tools to record gameplay footage. (This is another reason you should aim for casual games - games where you can play an entire game or a whole level within a 5 minute window are ideal.)

1. Submit your code (either a zip file of the code or a GitHub repository link that you have given me access to) along with your short report and video file to the D2L dropbox.

    > If you fork the GitHub repository and wish to share a link to the code, please ensure that my GitHub username - `fmillion-mnsu` - has access to the repository. **Zero points will be given if I am unable to access your code!** To be absolutely safe, submit a ZIP file of your code even if you do give me GitHub access.

This is a **group submission** - each group need only provide *one* submission.

Submission is due **May 9th, 2025** at **11:59 PM**.
