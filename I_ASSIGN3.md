# Activity 3 â€“ CS 470, Spring 2025

## Instructions

This one is simple. Select one of the [Laws of UX](https://lawsofux.com/) and design a short presentation, demonstration, or other method of explaining it to the class.

You have a lot of creative freedom here! You can show a few slides, a live demo (ideally poor example and good example), or even some type of physical manifestation. 

The only requirements are:

* Cover the topic accurately
* Include some method of providing an example of the topic - be creative!
* Your presentation should take no more than 5 minutes.

## Steps

1. On D2L, go to the Communication tab and then choose Groups. Select the topic you're interested in presenting on and enroll in the group named after that project under Presentation/Demo Topic.

    > Topic selection is first-come, first-serve! 

1. Build or design your presentation, demo, etc.

1. Present it on the last day of class - May 1, 2025!
