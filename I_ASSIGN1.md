# Activity 1 – CS 470, Spring 2025

## Instructions

> This project is a **moderated usability test**. A moderated usability test usually involves specifying a set of tasks or instructions for users to follow, and asking users to document their experience, both subjectively and objectively.
>
> When you think about user testing for your application, consider a model similar to this project for your tests!

Imagine that you are a student who is considering attending Minnesota State University, Mankato. 

Perform the following tasks on the MSU website (<https://www.mnsu.edu>). While doing the tasks, pay attention to and think about the [Ten Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).

1. Select a **4-year bachelor’s major** (other than your own major – i.e. not computer science!). Look around the site to learn about the requirements for that major.
    
    In particular, discover what courses you need to take to complete the major, as well as what the general education requirements are for the university as a whole.

2. Try to see if you can find a “course plan” – that is, a suggestion or a map for what courses you should be taking each semester in order to obtain a bachelors’ degree in the major you selected.

3. Determine if your major has extra requirements, such as licensing. If so, investigate those requirements and how you would obtain them in the course of your education. (An example would be elementary education - teachers must obtain teacher licensure in order to teach in public K-12 schools.)

4. Locate an E-mail address of someone you can contact if you were a prospective student with questions about your chosen major.

Now, answer the following questions in a Word document. 

1. What major did you choose?

2. How did you go about locating the information for the major? Give a basic description of what you actually did once you got to the site. For example, did you start by searching or by using the navigation menus?

    * Was there anything on the MSU site that stood out to you or guided you to the information you sought? 

    * Were there any barriers or challenging interfaces or pages that made finding the information harder?

    > This is a written version of the "think out loud" protocol. It might be helpful for you to record your screen and actually speak out loud while you explore the site, so you can go back and review your recording to write this section.

3. Were you able to find a course plan? (If not, that’s OK – ability to locate information is an example of a user task that a system ideally should help the user with, so document this as a barrier.) If you found the course plan, did you find it in a logical place? 

4. Overall, were there any interactions that particularly stood out to you – either positively or negatively? Identify at least two interactions and describe which heuristic the interaction related to and whether it did or didn’t meet the definition of the heuristic. 

5. Compare your experience on the website as a prospective student to the experiences you typically have using the MNSU website as a current student (e.g. to find information on declaring your major, applying for graduation, etc.) Did you find your experience as a prospective student *better*, *worse* or *about the same* as your experience as a current student? Why?

Submit your report to the D2L dropbox for “Individual Assignment 1 - MNSU Site User Test”. 

Submission due Tuesday 3/25/24 at 11:59 PM.
