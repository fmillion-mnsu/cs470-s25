# Comparison of User Test Results

By now, each of you has completed the [User Test assignment](I_ASSIGN1.md).

This assignment is simple: In your groups, discuss your results. Identify and report on the following:

* What aspects of the test did your group members all **agree** on - i.e. which steps or processes were universally easy or difficult? 
* Can you point to specific reasons why you think these similarities occurred? 
    * Examples: you all happened to choose the same major to search, you all are students and thus have more experience with the site...
* Now, focus on the aspects of the test that your group members **disagreed** on. Which parts of the test did you differ in your evaluation of the heuristics and of the overall process?
* **Why** do you think you disagreed on these points? Consider the usability heuristics, your own experiences, and so on.
* **As a group**, consider recommendations you *all* have for potential improvements to the MSU website based on the tasks given in assignment 1. 

Write all of your findings as a group in a document. No specific format is needed - consider this to be a type of "group reflection", and you can use whichever medium you find most appropriate to convey your points.

You must include:

* What aspects of the tests you agreed on and why
* What aspects you disagreed on and why
* If you either fully agreed *or* fully disagreed, why?
* What recommendations do you have as a group for improving the user experience? Consider *all* of your opinions and experiences when considering these recommendations!
    * You do not have to give *concrete* changes, but avoid overly generic or nonspecific recommendations like "the site should be easier to use" - be *specific* on how it should be easier to use.
    * Feel free to include screenshots or mockups to illustrate your points!

This is a **group submission** - each group need only submit *one* essay.

Submission is due **April 4th, 2025** at **11:59 PM**.
