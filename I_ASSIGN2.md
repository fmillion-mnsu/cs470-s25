# Activity 2 – CS 470, Spring 2025

## Instructions

Identify a deceptive (“dark”) pattern that you have either experienced directly or that you have observed. Focus on a computer-based (including mobile devices) interaction – while deceptive patterns definitely apply to real-world interactions, try to think of a specific example in a website or application.

Answer the following questions in a Word document:

1. Describe the interaction and why it could be considered a deceptive pattern.

2. Identify which type(s) of deceptive pattern your interaction represents and why. Since the classifications of deceptive patterns can be loose, you can use the examples on Deceptive Design's website (<https://deceptive.design/>) as well as their older Wiki-based site (<https://old.deceptive.design>) for guidance and examples.

3. Identify which of the ten usability heuristics the interaction is not supporting and why. 

    Your example may represent more than one heuristic. Describe how the deceptive interaction goes against the recommendations of the heuristic(s) you identify.

    > As a simple example, a forced interaction is not supporting heuristic 3 (user control and freedom) and heuristic 7 (flexibility and efficiency).

4.	If possible (not strictly required, but helpful) provide a screenshot of the interaction.

You don’t need to write much for this – a couple of paragraphs is sufficient, just make sure you cover all of the above points.

Submit one submission per individual to the D2L dropbox for “Individual Activity 2 - Deceptive Patterns Report”. 

Submission due Tuesday 4/1/24 at 11:59 PM.
